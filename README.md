My goal of this logo is to form a personal brand in which it is easy to identify me. I chose the `S` for many reasons but the main one is for my middle name sundar, I also gave it shape with these signs that are widely used in html `<>`, as for the colors was a taste for the colors I use most when programming and somehow I feel identified.
